# InheritanceImplementation
Please write a program in which the inheritance process will be used - the Staffclass will inherit from the base class Person.
The Person class contains fields: surname, first name, street, zipCode, city and two methods (can be void) initialize() and print(). The first one allows you to enter data, while the second one displays it on the console.
The Staff class includes two additional fields: education and position, and two additional methods (also of void type): initialize1() and print1() - both of thesemethods call the appropriate methods from the Person class in their bodies, but also implement handling (downloading and displaying) fields with Staff class.
In the other class create main() method, and create an object (we can use the default constructor) of the class Staff and call the methods on it.
